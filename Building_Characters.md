# Building Characters

This system allows you to customize your team and prepare it for battle.
Before starting, agree with your opponent on the point limit for the game.
Then, consult the following tables to build your characters and equip them until you reach the point limit.

1. Pick a miniature and name it. (e.g. "Varian")
2. Set the attribute values for the characters
3. Choose Equipment 

## Character Attributes

Each character has a set of four attributes: Melee, Ballistics, Toughness, and Agility.
* Each point in **Melee** grants the character an additional die in close combat. With a Melee value of 0, the character cannot parry or deal damage in close combat.
* The **Ballistics** value determines the number of dice rolled for shooting actions. The character cannot make any ranged attacks without a Ballistics value.
* **Toughness** sets the maximum stress level and the character's breaking point. Without any points in Toughness, the character is out of combat before the fight even begins
* The Agility value affects the character's maximum movement range and their climbing and jumping ability. Without any Agility, the character cannot move.

To increase an ability score, you must spend 3 points.

| Attribute Score | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4  | 5  |
|-----------------|---|---|---|----|----|
| Point Cost      | 3 | 6 | 9 | 12 | 15 | 

Usually the character attribute scores typically range from 2 and 5. Below is a table for reference, showing the sum of all attributes. and point cost needed.

|------------:|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------:|
| Critical    | To use the effect as part of critical hits                         | divide the cost by 2         |
| Random      | If the effect is bound to a die                                    | use the average dice roll    |
