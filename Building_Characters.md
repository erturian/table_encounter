# Building Characters

This system is about customizing your own team, to get it into the fight.
In preparation of your game, you must agree with your opponent about the point limit you want to set for the game.
After this, consult the following tables to build your characters and their equipment until you reach the point limit.

1. Pick a miniature and name it. (e.g. "Varian")
2. Set the attribute values for the characters
3. Chose Equipment 

## Character Attributes

Each character has a set of four attributes: Melee, Ballistics, Toughness, and Agility.
* Each point in **Melee** will give the character an additional dice in close combat fights. The character will neither be able to parry, nor do damage in close combat fights with a melee value of 0.
* The **Ballistics** value translates into dice for the shooting action. The character won't be able to make any range attacks without ballistics
* **Toughness** sets the maximum stress level and the literal break point of a character. Without a single point in toughness, the character is simply out of combat before the actual fight.
* The Agility value affects the character's maximum movement distance and the ability to climb and jump. No Agility means, the character won't be able to move.

To raise an ability score, you must spend 3 points.
