# Table Encounter - an open source skirmish tabletop srd

## Work in Progress

This is a work in progress and is being updated.

## Why this project and who am I?

Hi, i am Erturian, a tabletop and rpg enthusiast with a predilection for game mechanis and my goal is to create a flexible, modular, miniature agnostic tabletop system for skirmish battles. 
I'd like to keep it simple, but it's harder to accomplish than it looks. The system shall have some nice mechanics to emphasis narrative situations to remember.
