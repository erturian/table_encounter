# Table Encounter - an open source skirmish tabletop srd

## Work in Progress

This is a work in progress and is being updated.

## Why this project and who am I?

Hi, I am Daniel, a tabletop and RPG enthusiast with a passion for game mechanics. My goal is to create a flexible, modular, miniature-agnostic tabletop system for skirmish battles. While I aim to keep it simple, achieving that balance is harder than it seems. The system will feature mechanics that highlight memorable narrative moments.
