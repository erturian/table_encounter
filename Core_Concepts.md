# Core Concepts 

## Characters and Abilities
Each model has a character card with four abilities: Melee, Ballistics, Toughness, and Agility.
* Melee primarily influences the ability to engage in direct combat. A high melee value allows for harder strikes and better parries.
* Ballistics allows the character to hit more accurately in ranged combat and increases the chance of critical hits.
* Toughness makes the character more resilient. They can endure more wounds and stay on their feet longer after taking hits.
* Agility affects the character's speed. Additionally, a nimble character can dodge, climb, and jump more effectively.

The attribute values typically range from 2 to 5. When creating your own characters, pay attention to the total sum of the attribute points. Hereâ€™s a quick overview:

| Sum    | Description        | Sum    | Description        |
|-------:|--------------------|-------:|--------------------|
| 8      | Worm               | 16     | Hero               |
| 10     | Minion             | 18     | Monster            |
| 12     | Ordinary Mortal    | 20     | Legendary Being    |
| 14     | Leader             |        |                    |

### Ability Tests
To perform an attribute test, roll a number of dice equal to the respective attribute. Each roll of 4 or higher (4+) is a success.

**Critical Tests:** Some tests also take into account critical successes and critical failures. In these tests, a roll of 1 is always a critical failure, and a roll of 6 is always a critical success.

## Stress and incapability
The toughness value of a character determines how well they can withstand wounds or stress situations in combat. Each time the character takes damage, their stress level increases by the same amount.

At the start of their activation, check the character's stress level. If it equals or exceeds the character's toughness value, they break down and must stay idle to recover. Resolve the following steps:

1. Lose all Activation Points.
2. Perform a stress test (critical toughness test).
3. If the character is still on the battlefield, reduce the character's stress level by the value of their toughness.

### Stress Test
Each failed roll reduces the character's toughness value by 1. A critical failure also adds 1 to the stress level. A critical success lowers the stress level by 1. If the toughness value falls to 0, the character's nerves break, or they are severely injured and can no longer continue the fight. Remove them from the game.

## Action Points
All models start each combat round with 3 action points. These can be spent during the round, especially when they are activated, to perform actions.
