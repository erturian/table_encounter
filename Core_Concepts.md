## Close Combat

First, players secretly divide their available dice pool into attack and defense dice. Then, they roll their dice simultaneously and compare their successes. A result of 4 or higher counts as a normal success, while a roll of 6 counts as a critical success.

Normal successes from defense rolls negate opposing successes from attacks, while critical successes from defense rolls can negate up to two normal or critical successes from opposing attacks.

## Shooting

First, the difficulty of the shot is determined: The distance between the shooter and the target sets the base difficulty. This difficulty is then increased by 1 for each obstacle in the line of fire. An obstacle is defined as any object (including models) that is larger than 1".
The shooting model now rolls a number of dice equal to its ballistic ability. If the sum of the rolled values is equal to or higher than the difficulty, it has hit its target.
